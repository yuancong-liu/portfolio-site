It's quite an embarrassing tale, but the other day, while trying to add some fantastic transition effects to this site, I ran into some difficult situations.

In the experience section, where cards are listed horizontally, I wanted to make them scale up and down when the mouse cursor is in and out. It would be easy (which actually is), as I was using flex-box to arrange them, and conducting a transition over `flex-basis` would do the job. However, I witnessed this weird phenomenon where a smooth transition was rendered at mouse-in but nothing at mouse-out.

I spent minutes searching the Internet, but no even seemingly related search results appeared.

## Put the `transition` property in the right place

I have been writing CSS code for a long time but have never been aware of where the right place to write the transition property is. Inside main classes or pseudo-classes, as long as it's working, it's totally fine to me. As the Pen I made below, when you write the `transition` property under the `:hover` selector, no transition at all would be rendered or even recognised by browsers. To put it simply, in the case where the `transition` property is defined within the base class, when an element is transitioning from a base class into a hovered state, whose styles are defined by a `:hover` selector, the transition effects are rendered because it still belongs to the base class, no matter if it's hit the hovered state or not.

To some extent, it's similar to the reason why you cannot add any transition to any element going `display: none;` as browsers would not allow any element to be removed from the screen GRADUALLY. To implement such effects, libraries like `framer-motion` may be necessary, but anyway, the basic methodology here is to differ the timing elements go `none` and reduce the opacity to zero before that.

## Bonus hack - `:hover` and `:not(:hover)`

Tale as old as time...

One day last year, I tried to use pure CSS to implement a tracing effect, by which, elements turn to some other colour immediately when mouse-in and gradually turn back when mouse-out. There, I discovered this hack.

Have a good day! ðŸŒˆ
